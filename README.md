# Sales Summary Application. This is a simple, single-page web application designed to fetch sales data from a `data.csv` file, calculate the total sales, and display it prominently. The application is built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS. ## Features *   **Data Fetching:** Automatically retrieves `data.csv` from the same directory. *   **Sales Calculation:** Parses the CSV to sum values from the 'sales' column. *   **Dynamic Title:** Updates the browser tab title with "Sales Summary [Current Date]". *   **Responsive UI:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface. *   **Error Handling:** Provides user feedback if `data.csv` cannot be loaded or processed. ## Setup To run this application, simply: 1.  Save `index.html` and `data.csv` in the same directory. 2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser. No special server setup or build process is required, as it's a client-side only application. ## File Structure *   `index.html`: The main single-page application. *   `data.csv`: The CSV file containing sales data (must include a 'sales' column). ## Development This application is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and styled with Tailwind CSS (CDN version). For local development, ensure your `data.csv` file is correctly formatted with a header row and a column named 'sales'. ## Contributing Feel free to fork this project, open issues, or submit pull requests. ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
